                    <li><p className="compostingContent">Compost is organic material that can be added to soil to help plants grow. Food scraps and yard waste together currently make up more than 30 percent of what we throw away, and could be composted instead. Making compost keeps these materials out of landfills where they take up space and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</p></li>
                    <li><p className="compostingContent" style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}>Use as mulch : Compost-as-mulch is a fantastic way to boost your gardenâ€™s harvest. Naturally absorbent and dense, compost applied to the soil surface will prevent evaporation when laid over drip irrigation or after watering. It will also prevent weeds from sprouting. Apply in a 3 to 6 inch layer and rake until even.</p></li>
                    <li><p className="compostingContent">Mix DIY potting soil : <p>{"\n"}</p>Finished compost makes an excellent addition to homemade potting soil. Remove large debris by passing compost through a half- to 1-inch soil screen. Mix in the following proportions:<p>{"\n"}</p>1 part compost<br></br>1 part vermiculite<br></br>1 part topsoil<p>{"\n"}</p>Use in container gardens and when potting up starter plants.</p></li>
                    <li><p className="compostingContent" style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}>Top dress garden beds : Twice each year we give our raised beds a hearty dose of finished compost. We sprinkle it along the soil surface, and soon seasonal rains wash the nutrients down to root level. Worms do the rest of the work, pulling the organic matter into the soil.</p></li>                
                    <li><p className="compostingContent">Feed container plants : When you freshen up the soil around your outdoor potted plants or transfer to bigger pots, add screened compost to boost growth. Mix with potting soil and/or peat moss for better absorption.</p></li>
