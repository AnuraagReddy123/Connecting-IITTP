        question: 'what are the biggest causes of climate change?',
        answer: 'There are several main causes of climate change. The biggest one is the burning of fossil fuels, as this is the primary cause of global warming as a result of more greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. The other big causes of climate change are deforestation, as this releases C02 and halts the release of oxygen, and many practices in the agricultural industry.         '

        question: 'What is the impact of climate change?',
        answer: 'The impact of climate change is extremely far-reaching, affecting our environment, fellow living creatures, and society. Some of the biggest repercussions of climate change include extreme weather events like flooding and droughts that lead to forest fires; mass extinctions of animal and plant species; melting ice glaciers that lead to rising sea levels; and changing wildlife habitats that can negatively affect many ecosystems.'

        question: 'What are fossil fuels',
        answer: 'The three main fossil fuels are coal, crude oil, and natural gas. They’ve named fossil fuels because they were formed from the fossils of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago, and their origins are the reason why they have a high carbon content. Fossil fuels are extracted using a range of methods, including mining, drilling, fracking, and acidizing, all of which are extremely harmful.         '

        question: 'What is my carbon footprint?',
        answer: 'A carbon footprint can belong to an individual or company and is essentially a measure of the total amount of greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere as a result of your actions. It’s usually measured in tonnes of CO2e. Reducing your carbon footprint is one tangible way you can try to make a difference and become more sustainable.'

        question: 'What is renewable energy?',
        answer: 'Renewable energy comes from energy sources that replenish themselves, and is, therefore, often naturally sustainable. For example, wind and sunlight are powered by nature itself, and so we can always rely on them for energy as long as the weather permits it. '

        question: 'What are the main pollutants of concern to the environment and human health?',
        answer: 'The ambient air quality pollutants of most concern on an EU-wide level are Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Particulate Matter (PM), Ozone (O3) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). They can impact on human health, ecosystems and vegetation and monitoring is carried out to determine their concentration levels.'
